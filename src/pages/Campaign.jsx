              Public awareness is a key communication tool for sensitizing
              communities on problems affecting them. One of the greatest
              limitations to good health is lack of knowledge necessary for
              ideological transformation of people on their health problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have identified several factors that fuel common lifestyle
              diseases on which we are building a powerful campaign to enable
              the public understand the problem.

            The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (2015-2030) acknowledge
            the growing burden of lifestyle diseases and aim to reduce by one
            third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030,

              <p>
                Poverty and lack of access to resources can increase the risk of
                lifestyle diseases. Lifestyle diseases expose families to a
                cycle of poverty by depleting family resources in prolonged and
                expensive treatment costs.

                nutrient diets which are cheap and readily available in periods
                of food crisis.
