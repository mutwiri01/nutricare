              That genetic information is coded in protein while enzymes and

                  Enzymes are proteins that help speed up chemical reactions
                  inside cells. Protein hormones are chemical messengers that

              Dietary culture shifts around the world in the last century led to
              popular consumption of carbohydrate-rich high calorie foods
              resulting in protein deficit.

            <p>
              At the same time, animal protein sources have become less
              affordable in most economies, due to rising production costs,
              deepening the nutrient shortfall.

            <p className="positive-paragraph">
              However, combined sources of plant proteins have proven sufficient
              to supply the crucial macronutrient and are fast being adopted to
              bridge the nutrient gap.

              Furthermore, animal protein sources are known risk factors for
              various diseases as compared to plant sources, as methods of
              raising stocks are highly compromised by use of drugs in fodder
              production and treatment.
